# Nonlinear Regression


##### This is python code for the nonlinear polynomial regression algorithm. In this little project, through nonlinear regression algorithm we use a higher-degree polynomial function to approximate a nonlinear behavior of an unknown function. In this project we use a dataset with two features: the horsepower of the car's engine and the fuel consumption of the car. Our object is to find the relation between two features.




#### The main object of this project is to write a nonlinear regression algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

"auto-mpg" which is a dataset in elementary steps in machine learning for regression tasks. Its main features are:

+ "horsepower": means the horsepower of the car's engine.
+ "mpg": means the fuel consumption of the car.
